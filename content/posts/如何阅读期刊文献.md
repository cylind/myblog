## how to "survey" the article

**feel free to stop reding the article at any point**
**write some notes so you don't have to reread the article again**

1. read the title anf keywoeds (these are probaly what you to look at the apper)
2. read abstract
3. read  conclusion
4. look at the tables & figures(including acptions)
This is really what was done in the work. This does not take much time so it is worth looking at before really getting into the details which will slow down the reading.


5. Read the introduction.
This is the background needed and why the studywas done.


6. Read the results and discussion.
This is the heart of the paper.

7. Read the experimental.
This is how they did the work. You only get to this point ifyou are really interested and need to understand exactlywhat was done to better understand the meaning of the dataand its interpretation.
